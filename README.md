# Forest Service Prototype
This is a Django application to test out an online permit of the non-commercial group use Forest Service permit.

## Guiding documents

This non-commercial group use permit prototype is being developed as part of initial, discovery research for a broader Forest Service ePermitting project. Read more in the [discovery plan](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/discovery-plan.pdf). 

As of November 9, we have completed our first round of discovery research on this prototype. Read the [findings and reccomendations](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/round1-findings-reccomendations.pdf) from our first round of feedback sessions on this prototype (none of the changes have been implemented yet). 

We are now conducting additional research on Christmas tree and outfitter/guide permits, as described in the [discovery plan](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/discovery-plan.pdf).

### Background
In general, this prototype is driven by the goals, users and features set forward at a special uses permitting kick-off workshop. Read more in the [special uses workshop summary](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/special-uses-read-out.pdf). In a few weeks, we will kick off a similar discovery effort for Christmas tree permits.
