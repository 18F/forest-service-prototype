# Forest Service Prototype
This is a Django application to test out an online permit of the non-commercial group use Forest Service permit.

## Guiding documents

This non-commercial group use permit prototype is being developed as part of initial, discovery research for a broader Forest Service ePermitting project. Read more in the [discovery plan](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/discovery-plan.pdf).

As of November 9, we have completed our first round of discovery research on this prototype. Read the [findings and reccomendations](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/round1-findings-reccomendations.pdf) from our first round of feedback sessions on this prototype (none of the changes have been implemented yet).

We are now conducting additional research on Christmas tree and outfitter/guide permits, as described in the [discovery plan](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/discovery-plan.pdf).

### Background
In general, this prototype is driven by the goals, users and features set forward at a special uses permitting kick-off workshop. Read more in the [special uses workshop summary](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/special-uses-read-out.pdf). In a few weeks, we will kick off a similar discovery effort for Christmas tree permits. Read more in the [Christmas tree workshop summary](https://github.com/18F/forest-service-prototype/raw/master/docs/christmas-tree-read-out.pdf).

## Local Installation

This app is designed to run on Python 3.5.2. `pyenv` is recommended for managing
your Python version, along with `pyenv-virtualenvwrapper` for managing the
dependencies installed with `pip`. With that, you can prepare your development
environment by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/18f/forest-service-prototype.git
cd forest-service-prototype
mkvirtualenv forest-service-prototype
pip install -r requirements.txt
createdb forest-service-prototype
cd forestserviceprototype
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver
```

The app should now be running at http://localhost:8000.

To generate some data from for development:

```
./manage.py create_permits
```

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). These guidelines are directions for opening issues and submitting pull requests, and they also detail the coding and design standards we follow.

### Branching

Release branch: `master`
Development branch: `develop`

### Testing

To run the `pytest` tests:

```
cd forestserviceprototype
./manage.py collectstatic
pytest
```

### Dependencies

This project uses `pip-tools` to manage dependencies. As a result, developers
should edit `requirements.in` and not `requirements.txt`.

For example:

```
echo Django >> requirements.in
pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in
pip-sync
```

### Factories

There are [factories](forestserviceprototype/specialuseform/factories.py) to produce data for existing models. Those factories are used to generate random data for tests or to populate the database during development. While they are random, they are still relatively constrained, and thus shouldn't be considered representative of all of the weird things that humans can try to do. For wackier data, consider using the ["Fuzzy" generators](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fuzzy.html) included in `factoryboy` instead of [`Faker`](faker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
